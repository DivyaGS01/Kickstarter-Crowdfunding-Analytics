# Kickstarter-Crowdfunding-Analytics
# Project Overview
Kickstarter is one of the largest crowdfunding platforms, enabling creators to raise funds for projects across categories like technology, art, music, and more. To understand the platformâ€™s performance and success factors, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Kickstarter data using Tableau and Excel. The goal was to uncover insights on funding success, backer behavior, and project dynamics to inform strategic decisions.
